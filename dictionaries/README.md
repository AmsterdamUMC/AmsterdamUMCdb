# Dictionaries folder
This folder is used to store the dictionaries as `csv`-files. The are created by running the [create_dictionaries.ipynb](./create_dictionaries.ipynb) notebook. Currently, it only creates lists of all available parameters in the tables of AmsterdamUMCdb. These are especially useful in the data exploration phase. The Dutch version of [SNOMED CT](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/) can be used as a starting point for (official) translations to English medical terms.

**To do**: mapping with [SNOMED CT](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/), [LOINC](https://search.loinc.org/searchLOINC/), etc.
