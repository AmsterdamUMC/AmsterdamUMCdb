# 4th ESICM Critical Care Datathon 2022
## AmsterdamUMCdb - Freely Accessible ICU Database

version 1.0.2 March 2020  
Copyright &copy; 2003-2022 Amsterdam UMC - Amsterdam Medical Data Science

## Introduction

To make the most of your time during the datathon, access to AmsterdamUMCdb will be provided using Google BigQuery using
Google Colaboratory as the main coding environment. This removes the necessity to download AmsterdamUMCdb, setting up a
database system and installing a coding environment.

## Running Colab

Open Colab with the *AmsterdamUMCdb with Google BigQuery and Colaboratory* **getting_started** notebook from the official AmsterdamUMCdb GitHub
repository: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AmsterdamUMC/AmsterdamUMCdb/blob/master/bigquery/getting_started.ipynb)

## The challenges

### Track 1: Stormy times ahead? Tune in to the lactate forecast!

Blood lactate: beloved of intensive care specialists but much more complex than just a marker of tissue perfusion. We
all know raised lactate is associated with worse outcome. We all think we know that we should do something about high
lactate. We believe we know what to do. But do we? We encourage teams in this track to forecast lactate: going up or
going down? Lots of things to think about. In who? When? What treatments help? What treatments hide the problem?

### Track 2: Hold on to your nephrons!

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in critical illness is associated with worse outcomes, sure, but by how much and is this the
same for everyone? Treatment strategies are often directed at attempting to increase the perfusion of the kidneys with
intravenous fluids and/or vasopressors. However, both have known serious side-effects. The effects of vasopressors on
flow rather than pressure depends on filling, but the venous system can bite too so is there a 'sweet spot'? Clinical
questions might include: Who will get it and when? Is it avoidable and what are the outcomes by patient characteristic?
Can we reduce acute kidney injury by tailored combinations of fluids and/or vasopressors?

### Track 3: How low should you go?

The use of low tidal volumes to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury is an area of intensive care that has stood the
test of time since the original ARDSNet publications. But why 6 ml/kg specifically, apart from the trial choice? How low
can you go? How low should you go? Does it matter the same for all patients, no matter how ill? Does it matter how long?
Does it matter when? Which is more important: tidal volume/Pressure above PEEP/respiratory rate or oxygenation (
PEEP/FIO2)? At the end of the day, all these variables are interdependent. So many questions!
