Copyright &copy; 2003-2024 Amsterdam UMC - Amsterdam Medical Data Science

## Introduction

To make the most of your time during the datathon, access to AmsterdamUMCdb will be provided using Google BigQuery using
Google Colaboratory as the main coding environment. This removes the necessity to download AmsterdamUMCdb, setting up a
database system and installing a coding environment. 

To improve reusability of the data and code, AmsterdamUMCdb will be made available in the OMOP Common Data Model format. To get a head start, you may want to have a look [here](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/).

## Running Colab
