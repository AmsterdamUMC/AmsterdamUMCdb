        "New atrial fibrillation is common in critical illness and has important haemodynamic and possibly neurological consequences. This track in the datathon invites teams to use data to investigate this. Clinical questions might include: Who will get it and when? Is it avoidable? What are its consequences? Can you predict and understand this better with data?\n",

        "## Track 2: Steroids: Should I, shouldn’t I?\n",
        "The debate about steroids in sepsis and septic shock will probably go on forever. In this track, teams are asked to look at their use and impact. Questions might address issues such as how well do they actually work? When should they be started, at what dose and in who? RCTs address the population- but can you use data to address the individual?\n",

        "Everyone knows that lactate is a predictor of outcome. But its origins are metabolically complicated and how much does it just represent physiological stress? Do we really need to measure it (so much)? Questions for this track could include what predicts lactate increase and decrease? What individual treatment strategies might affect lactate levels and how effective are they? Are there individuals or circumstances where it’s measurement is crucial (or situations where it is unnecessary)?\n",

In combination with BiqQuery DataTables, it's possible to quickly locate an item of interest. Since AmsterdamUMCdb originated from a real Dutch ICU database, the original item names are in Dutch. For common ICU parameters, translations have been provided. Full mapping to [LOINC](https://decor.nictiz.nl/art-decor/loinc) and [SNOMED CT](https://decor.nictiz.nl/art-decor/snomed-ct) is currently in progress, but we are happy to take [pull requests](https://github.com/AmsterdamUMC/AmsterdamUMCdb/pulls) for the [dictionary.csv](https://github.com/AmsterdamUMC/AmsterdamUMCdb/blob/master/amsterdamumcdb/dictionary/dictionary.csv) file, if you have any improvements to the file."
