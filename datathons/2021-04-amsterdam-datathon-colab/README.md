# 3rd Critical Care Datathon 2021 on AmsterdamUMCdb - Freely Accessible ICU Database

version 1.0.2 March 2020  
Copyright &copy; 2003-2021 Amsterdam UMC - Amsterdam Medical Data Science

## Introduction
To make the most of your time during the datathon, access to AmsterdamUMCdb will be provided using Google BigQuery using Google Colaboratory as the main coding environment. This removes the necessity to download AmsterdamUMCdb, setting up a database system and installing a coding environment.

This tutorial for datathons using AmsterdamUMCdb is based on the original Google BigQuery tutorial on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/bigquery.ipynb).

## Before you Begin
Ensure you have a working Google account and verify that the e-mail address used when registering for the Datathon has been associated with this account. If you already have a Google account, you can add secondary e-mail adresses [here](https://myaccount.google.com/alternateemail), or alternatively create another Google account using the e-mail adress used during registration of the Datathon.

If you don't have any experience in using Jupyter notebooks and/or Python, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with the [basics](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).


## Running Colab
Open Colab with the **getting-started** notebook from the official AmsterdamUMCdb GitHub repository: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AmsterdamUMC/AmsterdamUMCdb/blob/master/datathons/2021-amsterdam/getting-started.ipynb)
