# Welcome

AmsterdamUMCdb is the first freely accessible European intensive care database. It is endorsed by the European Society
of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) and its Data Science Section. It contains de-identified health data related to tens
of thousands of intensive care unit admissions, including demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests and medications.

# Version

The current version of AmsterdamUMCdb is 1.0.2, released in March 2020. This version contains data related to 23,106
intensive care unit and high dependency unit admissions of adult patients from 2003-2016. The first version of
AmsterdamUMCdb (1.0) was released in November 2019.

# Requesting Access

The database, although de-identified, still contains detailed information regarding the clinical care of patients, so
must be treated with appropriate care and respect and cannot be shared without permission. To request access, go to
the [Amsterdam Medical Data Science](https://amsterdammedicaldatascience.nl/) website.

# Facts and Figures

The current database contains data from the clinical patient data management system of the department of Intensive Care,
a mixed medical-surgical ICU, from Amsterdam University Medical Center. The clinical data contains 23,106 admissions of
20,109 patients admitted from 2003 to 2016 with a total of almost 1.0 billion clinical observations consisting of
vitals, clinical scoring systems, device data and lab results data and nearly 5.0 million medication records.

# amsterdamumcdb Python package

The `amsterdamumcdb` Python package contains common functions for working with the database.

## Available functions

### *amsterdamumcdb*.get_dictionary():

Gets a dictionary of all items in AmsterdamUMCdb with translated medical concepts mapped to LOINC, SNOMED CT
or ATC (work in progress).

+ Returns:
    + dataframe containing dictionary

### *amsterdamumcdb*.get_fluidbalance(admissionid, from_date, to_date, con):

Calculate the fluid balance (i.e. fluid input - fluid output) for a specific time interval. Typically this will be used
to calculate daily fluid balances.

+ Arguments:
    + admissionid -- the admissionid of ICU admission
    + from_date -- the start of the interval, expressed as the number of milliseconds from start of this ICU admission
    + to_date -- the end of the interval, expressed as the number of milliseconds from start of this ICU admission
    + con -- psycopg2 connection or pandas-gbq Google BigQuery config

### *amsterdamumcdb*.outliers_histogram(data, z_threshold=4.0, lower=None, upper=None, bins=None, binwidth=None, maxbins=None):

Return a pyplot histogram, where the upper and/or lower outliers are binned together for a more even distribution plot.
By default, the histogram will be created with bins that are on boundaries aligned with the pyplot axis ticks.

+ Arguments:
    + data -- dataframe to create the histogram for.
    + z_threshold (Optional) -- number of standard deviations from the median to determine outliers
    + lower (Optional) -- lower threshold for binning lower outliers together
    + upper (Optional) -- upper threshold for binning higher outliers together
    + bins (Optional) -- int or sequence or str, allows specifying the number of bins, the actual bins or a binning
      strategy
      (see: https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html)
    + binwidth (Optional) -- forces a specified size of the equally sized bins between the lower and upper threshold
    + maxbins -- the maximum number of equally sized bins to create

## Changelog

### version 0.2.1
+ unified PostgreSQL and BigQuery processing
+ Fixed filtering based boolean indexing using `np.NaN` (pandas default) and `pd.NA` (used by pandas-gbq since the default is `Int64`) leading to different results, particularly when finding the complement using negation.
+ Added unit tests for the cohorts. Forces `pd.Na` to be considered `False` during comparisons.
+ By default, uses only validated data for `amsterdamumcdb` functions for consistent PostgreSQL and BigQuery results.
+ Removed aggregation in SQL code of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) in line with other functions.
+ Update SOFA GCS processing for more accurate scoring
+ Added rounding to 1 decimal for conversions (from `kPa` to `mmHg`) in SQL statements
+ Updated deprecated matplotlib style (`seaborn-darkgrid`)
+ Update engine to SQLAlchemy for official pandas support instead of direct psycopg2 connection
+ Moved code from Jupyter `reason_for_admission.ipynb` notebook into `amsterdamumcdb.cohorts` module.


### version 0.2.0
+ added sample cohorts (sepsis-3, mechanical ventilation, shock) in `cohorts.py`
+ added SOFA scoring to `scores.py`
+ util functions for PostgresSQL to BigQuery translation
+ move SQL code from notebooks to separate SQL files

### version 0.1.5

+ dictionary: as part of the `ICUnity` project in preparation for
  the [The Dutch ICU Data Warehouse](https://www.icudata.nl/index-en.html) a number of commonly used items have been
  mapped to [LOINC](https://decor.nictiz.nl/art-decor/loinc)
  , [SNOMED CT](https://decor.nictiz.nl/art-decor/snomed-ct) or [ATC](https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/) with data in
  the `vocabulary_id`, `vocabulary_concept_code`, `vocabulary_concept_name` columns.
+ dictionary: [UCUM](https://ucum.org/ucum.html) units added

### version 0.1.4

+ fixes binning in `outliers_histogram()` when all values < 1

### version 0.1.3

+ Improves binning in `outliers_histogram()`

### version 0.1.2

+ Allows negative dates in `get_fluidbalance()`

### version 0.1.1

+ Fixes Google BigQuery `Project must be a string` error.

### version 0.1.0
